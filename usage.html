<section id="fitter-physically-modeling-host-galaxies">
<h2>Fitter: Physically modeling host galaxies<a class="headerlink" href="#fitter-physically-modeling-host-galaxies" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fitter object uses spectroscopy and photometry of a host galaxy before a supernova to physically model the host. This can be used to subtract the host spectrum from the supernova, allowing for extraction of the supernova spectrum; or to learn about the properties of the host galaxy local to the supernova. This documentation explains how to perform this fit and use various utility functions around the fitting.</p>
<p>Some choices made when performing the fit will decrease the time cost but also decrease the precision and accuracy. Other choices will do the opposite—increasing time while also increasing precision and accuracy. These choices are as follows:</p>
<p>method: The frequentist method to use when running the initial fit. Some choices will run faster or more accurately than others. Current default is the trf method from scipy.least_squares, which is generally fast and reliable. Other recommended methods are lm from least_squares and Nelder-Mead from optimize.</p>
<p>use_bayes: If True, the full Bayesian fit will provide a more complete exploration of the parameter space and give a better uncertainty estimation. This can take a lot of time. If False, only the frequentist fit results are returned but the function runs much faster. Note that right now use_bayes=True is NOT supported.</p>
<p>one_sed: If True, each pixel is assumed to have the same spectrum, so only one simulation is performed in each pass. This saves time, especially in cases where the host galaxy covers a large number of pixels, but means that local variations in the galaxy are not accounted for. If False, each pixel is assigned a unique SED. This required more simulations to be run, but allows the galaxy to vary more between locations.</p>
<p>sim_code: Choice to use either BC03 or FSPS to simulate the SEDs. BC03 allows for fewer inputs and provides fewer outputs, but runs much faster. FSPS runs slower, but allows a great diversity of input parameters and outputs many useful quantities. Only FSPS can fit for metallicity at this point. Note: the number of FSPS parameters to fit may also impact runtime.</p>
<p>BC03 and FSPS behave differently in execution. Because BC03 uses a smaller number of input parameters, all parameters based on the inputs will automatically be fit for. FSPS can have an enormous number of input parameters, so you must select which ones you want to run. Further specific notes are below.</p>
<p>BC03:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For SFH1 or -1, ensure gas recycling is set and that epsilon is included in the initial guess.</p></li>
<li><p>For SFH 6, file names cannot be iterated over. In general this SED choice is not recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>SFH 7 is not currently supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Right now, the command line outputs for BC03 are redirected into a log file named bc03_logfile.txt. This file will be saved in your working directory if you want to read it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>FSPS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SFH 2 and 3 are not currently supported. SFH 2 is not supported by pyFSPS and so is unlikely to become available in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Any parameters that are not used by the IMF, SFH, dust, and other selections will not be fit for. Ensure that your desired fittable parameters match your non-iterable parameter choices.</p></li>
<li><p>Not setting any variable in the section fsps_params will leave it as the default</p></li>
<li><p>Not setting any variable in the section fsps_optional will mean it is fit for. To keep any variable in this section fixed, that is, to NOT fit it, set either to a chosen value or the string “default” to keep it as the default variable.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="the-fitter-object">
<h2>The Fitter object<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fitter-object" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The “fitter” object is the object that will perform the fitting. Its inputs are related to the host galaxy desired as the final output of the simulation. For example, if the supernova was first detected in image1.asdf,  the initial inputs for the fitter object should be related to image1.asdf. Fitter takes in the direct photometric image (not the spectroscopy image) of the discovery. When initialized, fitter creates a simulator object for this direct image,  finds the corresponding segmentation map, and retrieves data from the segmentation map that will be useful later. If direct image is not valid or there is no matching segmentation map, the object will not be created. The RA and DEC of the object to be fit can also be given here or added later. The spectrum image containing the supernova must also be provided.</p>
</section>
<section id="fitter-utility-functions">
<h2>Fitter utility functions<a class="headerlink" href="#fitter-utility-functions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fitter object contains several utility functions to aid in setting up the fit.</p>
<section id="pick-object-id">
<h3>pick_object(id)<a class="headerlink" href="#pick-object-id" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function allows the user to select the object they want to fit from a segmentation map containing many objects. The input is the number assigned to that object in the segmentation map, which can be either found by hand or retrieved with one of the get_ID functions below. This function recreates the simulator object, writes new segmentation map data, and rewrites other relevant parameters as needed. If the ID is not present in the segmentation map, this function returns an error.</p>
</section>
<section id="get-id-xy-x-y">
<h3>get_ID_xy(x, y)<a class="headerlink" href="#get-id-xy-x-y" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function retrieves the number assigned to the object at pixel coordinates (x, y) based on the segmentation map</p>
</section>
<section id="get-id-ad-ra-dec">
<h3>get_ID_ad(ra, dec)<a class="headerlink" href="#get-id-ad-ra-dec" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function retrieves the number assigned to the object at world coordinates (ra, dec) based on the segmentation map</p>
</section>
<section id="make-map-ra-dec">
<h3>make_map(ra, dec)<a class="headerlink" href="#make-map-ra-dec" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This function combines get_ID_ad and pick_object. If RA and DEC were provided at initialization, they do not need to be given again here. If RA and DEC were provided and are also input in this function, the RA and DEC input in the function will override the RA and DEC from initialization.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-fit-function">
<h2>The fit function<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fit-function" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the primary function of the object that performs the fit. It requires as input the data that should be used in the fit, an initial guess, and a configuration file. Its outputs are configurable and include the parameters of the best fit, the simulated best fit image, and the simulated best fit image subtracted from the image containing the supernova. It can either automatically retrieve all data from the Roman database containing given coordinates with certain criteria or use only a provided list of files or image IDs. It can also fit using files in a local directory or personal machine.</p>
<section id="input-data">
<h3>Input data<a class="headerlink" href="#input-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The input data is divided in spectroscopic and photometric data. If using the NERSC database, data can be pulled automatically based on coordinates and date, or specifically using a list of file paths and/or UUIDs. If using local data, each can be provided as a path to the files in the form of a string or as a list of strings that are complete paths to the desired files. Set to “None” if not using this type of data for local machines. The program will not proceed if no valid data is provided. Note that using “local” will assume that the provided files are in fits format.</p>
</section>
<section id="initial-guess">
<h3>Initial guess<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-guess" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The initial guess is a vector containing initial guesses for the desired fit parameters. The length must match what the program expects based on the number of fit parameters and the number of pixels. If this is not the case, the program will stop and log an error.</p>
</section>
<section id="configuration-file">
<h3>Configuration file<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-file" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The configuration file contains all the information needed to perform the fit. As much as possible, the function will ensure these parameters are valid and prevent the program from proceeding if they are not. It will also log an error stating which parameter is incorrect. An example configuration file is provided [here]. More details on the parameter options are also given below.</p>
</section>
<section id="timing">
<h3>Timing<a class="headerlink" href="#timing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some sections may take a lot of time and it can be difficult to tell if this is a problem or not. Reference times are provided here. If your program routinely exceeds these times, there may be something wrong. Any portion not specified here should not take more than a minute or two.</p>
<p>Overlapping pixels - In general, overlapping pixels should take about 1 seconds for every 100 pixels. So, if you have two images with 100 pixels each, overlapping pixels should take about 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Performing the fit - This is the most variable section. Some reference times are provided here, giving number of pixels, number of images, choice of simulation code, use of one SED for all pixels, and number of parameters to fit for. Keep in mind that the choice of initial guess and other choices may influence these results.</p>
<p>Simulating best-fit image – Should be on the order of seconds to a minute. Longer than a minute is cause for concern.</p>
<p>A note: in some cases, this code may take a long time to run. One useful thing you can do is import Audio from IPython and set a sound file to play automatically after the code has run. I find this helpful because I can do other things and return to the long-running code when it’s done.</p>
</section>
<section id="troubleshooting">
<h3>Troubleshooting<a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>For the most part, error messages produced by the code will be written to the log and should be informative on the cause of the problem. Assertion errors may appear directly in the environment where the code is run, but should also be largely informative on the variable causing the problem. Listed here are errors I have encountered in testing. If you find new errors that are not already addressed here, please reach out to me at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:isaac413&#37;&#52;&#48;umn&#46;edu">isaac413<span>&#64;</span>umn<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>. I will add it here with a solution if possible.</p>
</section>
<section id="common-errors">
<h3>Common errors<a class="headerlink" href="#common-errors" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Residuals not finite at initial point – this is usually an error that results from one of the pixels in the error file being set to zero, leading to a divide by zero error. It may also result from the initial guess being very far off, which can cause an underflow error. First check for zeros in the error file, then consider trying some other initial guesses.</p>

<p>properties that will eventually be pulled from the database or hard-coded in.</p>
<p>z (float) – the redshift of the object, NOT metallicity. This is required to run the fit and must be greater than zero. It is currently retrieved from the truth tables</p>

<p>actual parameters of the fit. These will be included in the provenance.</p>
<p>mjd_min_offset (float) – lowest MJD offset from discovery to use if automatically retrieving data. Default is 90, i.e. no images will be pulled more than 90 days before discovery</p>
<p>mjd_max _offset (float) – highest MJD offset from discovery to use if automatically retrieving data. Default is 30, i.e. no images will be pulled less than 30 days before discovery</p>
<p>method (string, optional) – optimization method to use for the initial fit. Allows all methods in scipy.optimize.least_squares and all objects in scipy.optimize.minimize that do not require a callable Jacobian. Default is least_squares with the trf method, which is fast and reliable.</p>
<p>use_bayes (bool, optional) – choice to use Bayesian statistics for a more complete exploration of the parameter space and uncertainty. Default is False. Currently not supported. If this is True, the best fit returned will be the median of the posterior with uncertainty and the best fit images will be made with these values.

FSPS is slower but allows for a lot of options for both input and output. BC03 does not permit the user to select which parameters to fit for as the number of parameters is inherently small. FSPS requires the user to select which parameters to fit for as the possible number of fit parameters per pixel can be very high.</p>
<p>one_sed (bool, optional) – choice to allow each pixel to have a unique SED or not. If True, every pixel is assumed to have the same SED. This means the SED simulation is only done once per pass, saving time. If False, each pixel gets a unique SED. This takes longer, but allows the galaxy to vary over space</p>
<p>buffer (int, optional) – buffer around the segmentation map to test for overlapping pixels when translating between different images. Default is 1, which should be plenty, but can be changed to be larger if faint or edge pixels are a concern.</p>

The string “default” will fix that parameter to the default value. Some of these parameters are only relevant for some of the inputs in the fsps_params category. If a parameter is not relevant based on those inputs, it will not be fit for and will be disregarded. Only a brief explanation is provided here. For more details, see FSPS documentation here.</p>

<p>delt – shift in the log of the effective temperature of TP-AGB isochrones. Default is 0.0.</p>
<p>redgb – weight given to the red giant branch. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>agb – weight given to thermally pulsing AGB. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>fcstar – fraction of Padova carbon stars that will be given the FSPS carbon star spectrum. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>sbss – specific frequency of blue straggler stars. Default is 0.0.</p>
<p>fbhb – fraction of horizontal branch stars that are blue. Default is 0.0.</p>
<p>pagb – weight given to post-asymptotic giant branch phase. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>frac_xrb – scaling factor for x-ray source spectrum. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>vdmc – IMF parameter when IMF is 3, defined in van Dokkum 2008. Default is 0.08.</p>
<p>mdave - IMF parameter when IMF is 4, defined in Dave 2008. Default is 0.5</p>
<p>igm_factor – Scale of intergalactic medium depth. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>masscut – truncate IMF above this value in solar masses. Default is 150.</p>
<p>uvb – strength of 2175Å extinction feature. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>logt_wmb_hot – Use Eldrige 2017 library for stars above this value of the log of the effective temperature. Default is 0.0, but will be 25000K if this value is lower than that.</p>
<p>bounds – the bounds to apply on any fit parameters, in the form [lower bound, upper bound], if use_bounds is True. Any parameter except age where a bound is not provided if use_bounds is True will be unbounded. Age is always bounded to the age of the universe unless overridden by another bounds input.</p>
<p>use_bounds (bool) – choice to use bounds or not. Age will be bound to the age of the universe if this is False. Age will always be bound from being less than zero, overriding any entered lower bound</p>
<p>All others – the name of the variable to be bound. Enter bounds as [lower bound, upper bound]. A note: tau is used as a variable by both BC03 and FSPS, and is only in the list once. Keep this in mind if you are using FSPS and want to apply bounds to tau.</p>
